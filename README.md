# Santander Cycles - Machine Learning Model

A Machine Learning Model trained to predict the number of bikes rented on a certain day, based on multiple factors such as weather, wind speed, humidity, etc.

## How I made it?
- Programmed in Python, using multiple libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit learn, etc.
- Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest.
- K-Fold Cross Validation is used.
- Classification Reports and Confusion Matrixs are printed to evaluate the preformance.

## Demonstration

Here is a link for a powerpoint I used to present this model for my Data Management and Business Intelligence Class: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SDBaRH-6CjF39k3FqGH7oEl5sXBajDfr4I9lfKWNghI/edit?usp=sharing
